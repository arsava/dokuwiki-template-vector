I) starter template CSS version
  <https://github.com/selfthinker/dokuwiki_template_starter/zipball/master> at
  2012-10-17 01:17 GMT+1


II) Modifications
  - I edited _links.css, _media_fullscreen.css, _toc.css:
    All url(images/[...]) rules were changed (-> "static/3rd/dokuwiki/"). To
    make this clear, a comment was added at the top of the files.
  - "static/3rd/dokuwiki/bullet|close|open.gif" were re-saved as PNG.


III) Notes
  The css files were taken from the "starter template". See the following for
  more information:
